Bash Scripting Project: Loops, Conditions, and Parsing
Overview
This project focuses on developing Bash scripts to reinforce knowledge and skills in scripting, particularly with loops, conditions, and parsing. Tasks include creating SSH keys, implementing various loops, using conditional statements, and parsing log files.

Project Structure
Each task is implemented as a separate Bash script file.
All scripts follow the guidelines specified in the project requirements.
Scripts are designed to be portable and compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Shellcheck is used for script validation to ensure adherence to best practices.

Tasks
-Create a SSH RSA key pair
Generate an RSA key pair and share the public key.
Keep the private key secure for future use.

-For Best School loop
Display "Best School" using a for loop.

-While Best School loop
Display "Best School" using a while loop.

-Until Best School loop
Display "Best School" using an until loop.

-If 9, say Hi!
Display "Best School" with "Hi" on the 9th iteration using an if statement.

-4 bad luck, 8 is your chance
Display different messages based on loop iteration using if, elif, and else.

-Superstitious numbers
Display numbers with corresponding superstitions using a case statement.

-For ls
Display directory contents in a specific format using a for loop.

-To file, or not to file
Provide information about a file using if and else statements.

-FizzBuzz
Display numbers with specific conditions using if and else statements.

-Read and cut
Extract specific information from a file using read and while loop.

-Tell the story of passwd
Format and display user information from /etc/passwd using IFS and while loop.

-Let's parse Apache logs
Parse and display visitor IP with HTTP status code from Apache log using awk.

-Dig the data
Group and display visitor data by IP and HTTP status code, ordered by occurrences using awk.

-Usage

Navigate to the desired task directory.
Execute the Bash script to perform the specified task.

-Dependencies
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.
Bash scripting environment.
Shellcheck for script validation.
